# Paris AirBnb Prices

A fun project to learn how to use Basemap in Python. I'll make a map of AirBnb listings in my favorite city, Paris, by price. 

### Data
listings.csv - a public domain .csv of AirBnb listings obtained on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juliatb/airbnb-paris#listings.csv)

arrondissments - a shape file of Paris downloaded free from [the French Government](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/arrondissements-1/).
