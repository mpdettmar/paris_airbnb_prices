# Paris AirBnb Prices

A fun project to learn how to use Basemap in Python. I'll make a map of AirBnb listings in my favorite city, Paris, by price. 

### Data
listings.csv - a public domain .csv of AirBnb listings obtained on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juliatb/airbnb-paris#listings.csv)

conseils-quartiers.shp - a shape file of Paris downloaded free from [MapCruzin](https://mapcruzin.com/free-france-arcgis-maps-shapefiles.htm)
